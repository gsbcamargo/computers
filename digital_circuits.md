# Digital Cirtuits


## What are digital circuits?


To answer that question, we must first address two concepts:

### Analogic Signals vs Digital Signals

The main difference lays in the fact that the amplitude axis of both signal types are different.

**Analogic signals'** amplitude values are **infinite**, while **digital signals'** amplitude values are **finite**.

Note that the Y axis on the digital signal graphic is finite. It has **two states**, **on** or **off**.
It can hold more than two values, giving that the amount of values is finite. E.g.: your fingers/toes.

An example of an analogic signal is your voice.
