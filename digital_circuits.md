# Digital Cirtuits


## What are digital circuits?


To answer that question, we must first address two concepts:

### Analogic Signals vs Digital Signals

The main difference lays in the fact that the amplitude axis of both signal types are different.

**Analogic signals'** amplitude values are **infinite**, while **digital signals'** amplitude values are **finite**.
